Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Purchaser agrees to pay all transportation charges incurred after goods are delivered to the common carrier, including any and all inspection/unloading/set-up costs and other incidental expenses. Should Seller pay any of these expenses in advance, Seller shall be entitled to invoice for these costs and Purchaser shall pay this expense upon receipt of invoice.
